# Nutricare Machine Learning Platform

Utilizes transfer learning models and TensorFlow Library for classifying obesity types and image object detection for food recommendation based on user ingredients.

### **Image Detection**
Image detection is based on transfer learning using MobilenetV2 models. Image detection is used in the mobile app to identify the image of cookoing ingredients and this dataset has 30 types of cooking ingredients that can be detected. The utilization of transfer learning through MobilenetV2 models enhances the efficiency of image detection in the mobile app, allowing for a more accurate and rapid identification of cooking ingredients. 

### **Obesity Detection**
This obesity detection uses TensorFlow in its development, by implementing a simple model architecture to identify obesity accurately. The model is trained using a dataset with six classes, where the system will use height and weight to calculate the user's BMI.

2. [Nutricare Image Detection](https://github.com/NusaSpot/detect-image)
3. [Nutricare Obesity detection](https://github.com/NusaSpot/detect-obesity)

#### Model Accuracy

**Obesity Detection Model**   
The obesity detection model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an impressive 97.62% accuracy on the training dataset. During testing, it maintains a commendable accuracy of 93.94%, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying obesity.

**Image Detection Model**   
For image detection, the model shows strong performance with 90% accuracy during training. During validation, it achieved 96.58% accuracy, emphasizing its ability to generalize well to new data. The robustness of this model was further validated with a test accuracy of 96.32%, which shows its reliability in accurately detecting objects in images.

# Getting Started

### Mobile Development
To get started with the mobile development application you can install Android Studio on your device and clone the repository [Nutricare Android App](https://github.com/NusaSpot/nutricare-android) into your local.

### Cloud Computing
Start to clone our project this can be cloned to your local system or deployed to cloud systems, We recommend you to use Google Cloud to deploy. We used Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL for our architecture here are the steps:

1. Create a Project on the Google Cloud Platform
2. Create Cloud SQL Instances (MySql)
3. Import Database from (https://storage.googleapis.com/nutricare/nutricare-database.sql)
4. Create Bucket on Cloud Storage
5. Clone, build, and deploy this machine learning API to Cloud Run
   - Image Detection: (https://github.com/NusaSpot/detect-image)
   - Body Status Detection: (https://github.com/NusaSpot/detect-obesity)
7. Clone, build, and deploy our web and API services to Cloud Run, but take a look at the .env.example at each repository for the reference environment that we used, also please assign a service account to each service that has (Storage Object Admin) Role
   - API : (https://github.com/NusaSpot/nutricare-api)

- [Obesity Detection Requirements](https://github.com/NusaSpot/detect-obesity/blob/main/requirements.txt)

Use '**pip install -r requirements.txt**' to install the required packages.  
3. Download the trained model and preprocessed dataset at the following link.:
- [Obesity Detection Model](https://github.com/NusaSpot/detect-obesity/blob/main/obesity_classification.h5)
- [Image Detection Model](https://github.com/NusaSpot/detect-image/blob/main/image_classification.h5)
- [Image Raw Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)
- [Image Clean Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wy8-M0xPY6KlGyT_74pPvYkvY8vwlPWu)
- [Obesity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/obesity-classification-dataset)
4. Place the model and dataset that have been downloaded into the same directory as the project that was cloned in the first step.
5. Explore the Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository to understand how to use the models for image or obesity detection.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebooks to load the models, preprocess the data, and perform detection.

### Custom Layers
In the implementation of our neural network architecture, we've incorporated several custom layers to enhance model performance and flexibility. The layers included are:

1. Global Average Pooling
2. Batch Normalization
3. Dropout
4. Dense(with 'relu' activation)
5. Dense(with 'softmax' activation)

### Training and Evaluation
The image detection model that has been created is compiled using the RMS Prop optimizer with learning_rate of 0.001 and categorical
cross-entropy loss. For the evaluation matrix, the model uses accuracy with 20 epochs for training.

### Pre-trained Model
The base model, MobileNetV2, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This pre-training empowers the model with a strong understanding of common visual representations, forming a strong foundation for transferring learning to specific tasks such as image recognition or detection.
